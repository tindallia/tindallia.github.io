summary:    It's been a while since I've touched web development. So I decided my first project would be my personal Github Page.

Yes, as the summary says, this is my first project in a while that is involving web development. Since I left university, I haven't touched web development at all. Currently I'm employed for programming software that requires no interface for human interaction, that is being for [smart cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card). ...And now I've decided that it's time to make stuff that is interactable with humans again. _It's a weird feeling making this kind of projects again after such an extended period off_.

I will be posting more soon what I'd like to do in my downtime. For now I've added one of my projects that's being in the backburner for too long and I decided to publish it anyway. The sideprojects will be the home of those downtime ideas and I'm very much open to feedback! I _really_ expect myself to really update this site from time to time.

Feel free to peruse and click all the links in this site and pop in to my inbox if you'd like.
