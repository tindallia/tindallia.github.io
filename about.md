I am an Embedded Software Engineer at [IDEMIA](https://www.idemia.com/) in Jakarta. Previously also a Business Analyst at [Bank Central Asia(BCA)](https://www.bca.co.id).
Graduated from [Universitas Padjadjaran](https://unpad.ac.id) with a bachelor's degree in computer science.

Other than my responsibilites in my current company, I'm also working to combine my technical expertise with my previous analyst role. Welcoming any opportunity to improve collaboration and bridging between the tech and other related industries.

My main areas of interest are in data visualisation, technical analysis, and project management.
